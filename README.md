# SEApeatmangrove

This repository contains code to generate map and calculate area of land use change impacted peatlands and mangroves in Southeast Asia between 2001-2022.

The analysis is mainly overlay analysis by using available datasets/maps from the literature such as peatlands, mangrove, annual deforestation or forest cover loss, deforestation drivers, annual burned area, oil palm, and canal drainage network distribution. Source of the data are described in the code description.

The code was developed in Google Earth Engine platform.

The mapping analysis was part of on-going study entitled "Peat swamp forest and mangrove conservation in Southeast Asia can reduce regional land-use emissions by 55%".

Access to the code: https://github.com/sigit-sasmito/SEApeatmangrove/blob/28f1f09d6a5b961b5ce1ab17622cc43027a71cca/Generate%20peat%20and%20mangrove%20land%20use%20change%20map 

Access to interactive map visualization of the original data resolution for new land uses that replaced peat swamp forests and mangroves are available through the following Google Earth Engine app: https://ee-sdsasmito.projects.earthengine.app/view/sea-peatmangrove.
